# Habit Tracker App

**Habit Tracker** is my final project for
[Harvard's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
It's built as **MVP** (minimal viable product) and it's core functionality is to
track user's habits.

## I'm now working on

- Test coverage
- Performance
- Accessibility

## Technologies

- **React** - my favorite library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **React Query** — fetching, caching and updating asynchronous state. Also, I
  could significantly improve performance by implementing **optimistic
  updates**.
- **React Router** — routing but also it was an opportunity to check out the
  newest React Router v6 that is still in beta.
- **React Hook Form** — forms and validation.
- **Material UI** — my favourite user interface library — it's easy to use and
  implement and it's just so much easier to make the app mobile friendly.
- **Firebase** - **Authentication**, **Realtime Database** and **Hosting**.

## Challenges

I learned a lot while building the project and for sure I'm going to learn a lot
more while maintaining it. That's why I want to keep track of the challenges
that I've had along the way so that I can reference them in the future.

### Database and data structure

How should I store habit's completion state for each day? Should each habit have
an array with the dates when it was performed or should I store dates and each
date would keep track of the habits that where performed on that day?

I tried to structure the data so that it is saved and retrieved as easily as
possible. To do so I've been following
[Firebase guidelines](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data)
and in the end came up with the following data structure:

```json
{
  "habits": {
    "user-one": {
      "habit-one": {
        "name": "Reading",
        "description": "Read a book for at least 30 min in the morning",
        "frequency": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
      }
    }
  },
  "checkmarks": {
    "user-one": {
      "checkmark-id": {
        "habitId": "habit-one",
        "date": "2020-11-11",
        "value": "completed"
      }
    }
  },
  "users": {
    "user-one": {
      "locale": {
        "code": "en-GB"
      },
      "theme": {
        "primaryColor": "blue",
        "secondaryColor": "red",
        "dark": true
      },
      "performanceGoal": 80
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Layer

For quite some time I was using Private and Public routes to prevent an
authenticated user from accessing the parts of the app available only for logged
in user. It was fine but I wanted to use a different layout for authenticated
users (additional sidebar on the left).

I found the perfect solution in a
[blog post by Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/authentication-in-react-applications):

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = useUser()
  return user ? <AuthenticatedApp /> : <UnauthenticatedApp />
}
```

### Localization and language

I've never before implemented this in an app and I really wanted to give it a
try. My main goal was to give the user an option to change their locale and
language. Although this goal was achieved, the solution is far from ideal. First
of all, I think that it would be better to split these two layers. For example
in YouTube one can open settings and change either Language or Location.
