# Maciek Sitkowski Portfolio

Hi, I'm Maciek Sitkowski, this is my personal portfolio. You can find here a
little bit about myself, my projects and a way to contact me.

This portfolio is hugely inspired by
[Kent C. Dodds personal website](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com).
I've never used Gatsby before so Kent's source code was an amazing source of
knowledge for me and I learned a great deal while reusing it.
